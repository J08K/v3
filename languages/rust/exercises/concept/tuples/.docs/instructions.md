# Instructions

You are a freelance developer living in a town that hosts an annual carnival. One fan favorite, "Lucky Leo's Guessing Game", runs on custom software. Your firm has been tasked with building it.

"Lucky Leo's Guessing Game" sits at the entrace to the carnival. Each day it speaks a message to carnival passersby. You must build the software to make it speak.

### 1. Create a tuple of messages for each day

- Use `&str` for verbal messages.
- Use 'char` for emojis


### 1. Create a function to print the message depending on the day

- Your function should accept a `usize` for the day of the week
- It should return the value for that slot

```rust
let hello = greeting(1);
```
